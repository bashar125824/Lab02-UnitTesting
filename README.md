# Lab02-UnitTesting


## Problem Domain

***In this lab , we apply Unit Testing on an ATM system with different methods ,*** 
***like Balance method , that show the current balance , and Withdraw method ,***
***that take a value as parameter and this value will be subtracted from the balance***
***and Deposit method , that take a value as parameter and this value will be addrd to the balance .***


***Also we put many constraints on these methods :***

- ***In Deposit method , we check if Deposit value isn't NEGATIVE***

- ***In Withdraw method , we check if Withdraw value isn't bigger than the balance and Withdraw value isn't NEGATIVE***


---

## Applying Unit Testing

***In every test for method , we want to guarantee that the method , is working well ..***

1. ***In Balance test , we guarantee that balance is correct in a format way***

2. ***In Withdraw test , we guarantee that balance after subtracting the withdraw value is not the same as before***

3. ***In Deposit test , we guarantee that balance after adding the Deposit value is not the same as before***

## How to use the app :

***In the above image , we see that we can choose what method we want by choosing the number of method , and you can choose what ever times you want , until you choose Exit , then it will terminate the program***
